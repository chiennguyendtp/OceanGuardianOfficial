### **"why not just create a configuration file?"**
> Configuration files are limited to variables and cannot change things such as functions, etc.
>
### **"Why not just use a portable python distribution and still be able to configure the files afterwards since it have its own directory for modules?"**
> A portable python distribution is still a large size approximately 700 MB (Depending on the version) This will not be very flexible for low end devices and 700 MB is too big for just a simple game.
